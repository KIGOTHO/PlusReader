This is a well-documented simple Android App using SQLite that displays different feeds from assorted websites 
which can be added by the user. The following libraries were used:
- Floating Action Button
- j-soup
- picasso
- text-drawable
- play-services-wearable

This app was made by Michael Kigotho (https://github.com/KIGOTHO) and I as homework during our tenure at the Moringa School
